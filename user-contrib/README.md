# user-contributed templates for LibreOffice Impress

Templates contributed by the community (you!). Please only include templates you have designed yourself and make sure to include a description in the table below.

All templates must have a license. If you are not sure what license to use and would like to leave open the possibility of your template being included in a future version of LibreOffice, you should license it [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en) (since that is what they usually require in their [calls for templates](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Design/Whiteboards/Templates_for_LibreOffice_5.0)). Any free/open license is fine for inclusion in this project, however.
