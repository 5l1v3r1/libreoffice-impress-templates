# lo51lyt

This collection contains a group of presentation templates that were included with version 5 of LibreOffice. As the list of included templates changes with every version of LibreOffice, users of different versions may not have access to these templates, so they are redistributed here for convenience.

The templates were originally installed to the directory `/usr/lib/libreoffice/share/template/common/presnt/`, and are all released under [a CC-0 license](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Design/Whiteboards/Templates_for_LibreOffice_4.4).
